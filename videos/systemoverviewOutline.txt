Basic Outline:


1. Installation
2. Machine Learning in Audio
   1. Audio -> noise detection(?) -> something else (?) -> something (?) -> product (?)
3. Report results
   1. Dashboard (desktop)
   2. App (mobile)




Notes from March 3rd meeting recording:
16 mics
capture activity birds and environment of barn in local activity
zones in house


aggregated in a hub
data sent to cloud for secondary data processing


Uses multi-class machine learning models to detect and count instances of anomalies
detecting anomalies - the unexpected
Trained on age groups of flock


cloud activity allows for dashboard, more sophisticated analysis








Title screen: “System Overview” with text animation


Cuts to art/diagram of barn house. Shows chickens inside, as well as the placement of microphones.


“Microphones are placed in regularly-spaced intervals within the chicken house to define zones”


Graphic that shows eight or so microphones within the barn


“Audio data is collected and monitored”


“AudioT utilizes multi-class machine learning models to detect and count instances of ‘coughs’”[a]


Animated chart graphic?




  

        Rough sketch of what i’m going to animate in after effects






“Results and monitoring are accessible through AudioT’s desktop dashboard, or mobile app” 


Footage of user going through dashboard and app




[a]there's a 3 step process drawn in the meeting picture but i can't read any of the handwriting

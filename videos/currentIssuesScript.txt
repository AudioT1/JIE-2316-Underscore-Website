Current Poultry Monitoring doesn’t tell the whole story

Current methods of poultry monitoring only account for environmental factors
Such as CO2 levels
And temperature
However it doesn't account for the poultry’s welfare outcome 

Also it is common to utilize human auditors to check welfare outcomes editors
But this method only gives a snapshot of the health of a few chickens 
Out of many
However the way to address this issue is through evidence based animal welfare

Out of all the sensors available there are 2 main ways of communicating what the animals are experiencing
The first being through visual sensing
And the second being auditory sensing 

For instance there are cameras and microphones, that work together great

And we’re going to tell you about audio

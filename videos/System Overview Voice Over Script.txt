The System Overview by AudioT


For the installation of the product, 16 microphones are placed in regularly-spaced intervals within the chicken house to define the zones.


These microphones help capture the activity of the chickens and barn environment in that zone.


All of the data from the microphones is then aggregated at a central master controller. 


This controller then stores the data locally and communicates it with the cloud for additional data processing.

                                The amount of specialized knowledge needed to be a poultry farmer is surprisingly great. Just by 
                                hearing one of their chickens, a poultry farmer can tell if they’re healthy, happy, hungry, or sick. 
                                It may seem instinctual to some, but that level of adaptation is made possible by the supercomputer

                                Over the past 50 years, the average size of broiler houses has doubled to compensate for increased demand from retailers
                                    in the poultry industry. Year by year, commercial poultry farmers are expected to produce more meat to fulfill that demand,
                                    which necessitates the ability to care for more chickens.

                                This dramatic increase in production has made it more difficult for poultry farmers to actively monitor the welfare of 
                                their chickens. Modern poultry farms can house birds numbering in the tens of thousands -- in a setting like this, it’s 
                                hard, even for skilled farmers, to pay attention to the needs of any particular chicken.

                                Additionally, contract growers are often obligated to submit a detailed report on their welfare practices and outcomes 
                                to their integrators in order to keep their jobs. There’s a lot of pressure on farmers to do their absolute best to satisfy 
                                the industry and to take good care of their animals at the same time, which is a difficult balancing act to achieve.

                                        Currently, common welfare practices for taking care of chickens include regulating environmental

                                        monitoring the animals. For example, when looking solely at the aggregate water consumption of a house, 
                                        there isn’t a way to tell whether all the birds are hydrated properly or if some are drinking too much or

                                        to gather and organize welfare data. Camera-based solutions have been making waves in the industry: 
                                        they’re a step in the right direction, but cameras are expensive to implement and aren’t optimal
